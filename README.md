# Old-Projects
These are some very old projects that I made long before I found the area of programming that I wanted to get into. If this gets more stars and attention than my main projects I'm gonna be sad.

# What Exactly is going to be here?
I might go looking for old scripts on my laptop that I used to program on, and I might as well plop them in here. These scripts are actually from a time where I used to game dev! It was very long ago(10ish months, around when I started to code). I also have a few old scripts, but mainly there's just going to be any old games that I've made in the past. The real reason I left game dev, was mainly because I found it too tedious(look at space invaders and the pokemon game and you'll see). This was also a time where I didn't really know how functions worked(I was horrible at optimization XD). 

# Why?
Not sure. I just get bored a lot so yeah.

# Happy Playing Around, DrSquidX
